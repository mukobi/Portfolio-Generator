  I built this configuration, data collection, and visualization software suite while interning at Ralf Widenhorn's physics lab at Portland State University. For this project, I developed, implemented, and tested software to interface with Pozyx, a high accuracy localized positioning system.

  We then tested and applied this software as a learning tool for hands-on college-level physics courses, as an advanced position and motion data collection device for professional athletes, and as a solution for other high precision localized positioning applications.
