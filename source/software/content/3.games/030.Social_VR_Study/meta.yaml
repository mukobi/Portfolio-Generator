  This is a test of a custom networking solution in Unity for handling networked virtual reality avatars with voice chat. Built off of a project from an ex-VHIL student, this project sseked to explore the viability of conducting a study that would investigate the efficacy of social VR on improving how students learned and retained information about ocean acidification.

  Broadly, the research question was asking if students who watched a video about ocean acidification and then discussed it in a VR coral reef would learn more than those who discussed it in a VR classroom. This is a project for Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL).
