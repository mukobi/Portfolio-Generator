            <h3>Portfolio Generator</h3>
            <p class="content_description line_white_space">
                I got really tired of having to manually update the HTML of my statically-hosted software portfolio, so I decided to be a real programmer and write a tool to automate it. Gone are the days of copy-pasting the previous project's div, searching around for all the right spots to change the titles and descriptions, and then getting frustrated when I want to reorder things or change a similar detail across multiple pages.

Instead, for any of my portfolio sites (including the one you're looking at now), this Python script reads meta files stored as YAML for each page or project, evaluates them against a set of templates using Jinja2, and copies over all other source files like images, JS, or CSS. The compiled HTML and copied files are neatly placed together, responsive CSS makes everything dynamically fit together well, and I can freely and efficiently share my work on a static site host and CDN.

            <h3>PSU Pozyx</h3>
            <p class="content_description line_white_space">
                This is a large piece of desktop software I built while interning at Ralf Widenhorn's physics lab at Portland State University. For this project, I developed, implemented, and tested software interfacing with Pozyx, a high accuracy localized positioning system, with applications as a learning tool for hands-on college-level physics courses, as an advanced position and motion data collection device for professional athletes, and as a solution for other high precision localized positioning applications.
