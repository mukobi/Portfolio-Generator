  This was the official website for the Camas High School chapter of the National Honor Society (NHS). NHS challenges its members to develop further through active involvement in school activities and community service. In the Camas chapter, members are frequently involved in helping out at such events as blood drives, the Lost and Found Cafe, the sock drive, tutoring, several charity-oriented senior projects, and more.
