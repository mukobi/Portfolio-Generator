  This is a large piece of desktop software I built while interning at Ralf Widenhorn's physics lab at Portland State University. For this project, I developed, implemented, and tested software interfacing with Pozyx, a high accuracy localized positioning system, with applications as a learning tool for hands-on college-level physics courses, as an advanced position and motion data collection device for professional athletes, and as a solution for other high precision localized positioning applications.
