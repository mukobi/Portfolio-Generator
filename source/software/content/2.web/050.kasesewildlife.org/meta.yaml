  A website for the nonprofit Kasese Wildlife Conservation Awareness Organization (KWCAO). KWCAO is a non-profit making project established in 2002 to create Wildlife Conservation Awareness among school children and communities who live near Queen Elizabeth and Rwenzori National Parksin Western Uganda.

  Since KWCAO's inception over 215 schools have been given wildlife presentations and materials that have helped in the conservation efforts of the valuable fauna and flora resources. Wildlife education is relatively new in the Kasese District (western Uganda). It is only through the Kasese Wildlife Conservation Awareness Organization that painstaking efforts are being made to integrate wildlife issues into the school curriculum.
