            <h3>Rogue Starfighter VR</h3>
            <p class="content_description line_white_space">
                Rogue Starfighter VR (RSVR) is an immersive virtual reality Star Wars X-wing flight simulator fan-game. In it, the player experiences the full scale and power of the space combat from a galaxy far, far, away behind the controls of an immersive and fully-interactive T-65B X-wing starfighter.

My main goals in RSVR’s development were to create compelling cockpit control interactions driven by the player’s VR hands; to create a beautifully fun experience through highly detailed and customized models, VFX, shaders, and sound design; and to learn a lot about game development by building a full vertical slice of a large project.

            <h3>Third Arm VR</h3>
            <p class="content_description line_white_space">
                What if you had a third arm? Would it be useful? How would you control it? We at VHIL needed answers to these questions, so I built this virtual reality demo. In it, you control a third arm that is either fleshy or robotic with several different combinations of your headset and two VR controllers, and you can play an addictive button popping game where you must learn mastery of all three of your arms.

This is a project for Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL). This experience is currently used as a live lab demo at VHIL and in "Virtual Becomes Reality: A Stanford VR Experience," a VR short film debuting at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival.

            <h3>Social VR Study</h3>
            <p class="content_description line_white_space">
                This is a test of a custom networking solution in Unity for handling networked virtual reality avatars with voice chat. Built off of a project from an ex-VHIL student, this project sseked to explore the viability of conducting a study that would investigate the efficacy of social VR on improving how students learned and retained information about ocean acidification.

Broadly, the research question was asking if students who watched a video about ocean acidification and then discussed it in a VR coral reef would learn more than those who discussed it in a VR classroom. This is a project for Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL).

            <h3>Homuncular Flexibility VR</h3>
            <p class="content_description line_white_space">
                Homuncular Flexibility is a virtual reality experience that seeks to explore the mind's ability to "remap" the roles of the limbs in regards to how they are controlled by the brain for theraputic and psychological applications.

To do this, I experimented with how the movements of your arms and legs in real life effect what you experience in VR via the avatar's movement (which was difficult when using inverse kinematic solvers built only for normal VR use). E.g. your arms might control your legs, or rotating a limb in real life might rotate it double in VR. This is a project for Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL).
