  Homuncular Flexibility is a virtual reality experience that seeks to explore the mind's ability to "remap" the roles of the limbs in regards to how they are controlled by the brain for theraputic and psychological applications.
  
  To do this, I experimented with how the movements of your arms and legs in real life effect what you experience in VR via the avatar's movement (which was difficult when using inverse kinematic solvers built only for normal VR use). E.g. your arms might control your legs, or rotating a limb in real life might rotate it double in VR. This is a project for Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL).
