  What if you had a third arm? Would it be useful? How would you control it? We at VHIL needed answers to these questions, so I built this virtual reality demo. In it, you control a third arm that is either fleshy or robotic with several different combinations of your headset and two VR controllers, and you can play an addictive button popping game where you must learn mastery of all three of your arms.

  This is a project for Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab (VHIL). This experience is currently used as a live lab demo at VHIL and in "Virtual Becomes Reality: A Stanford VR Experience," a VR short film debuting at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival.
